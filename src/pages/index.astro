          We’re here to help you thrive.
        </h2>
        <p>
          The vast majority of CPG startups fail in spectacular fashion. It is easy to have an idea, but the demands
          from distributors, retailers, and co-packers often come as a rude shock. In order to succeed, you need
          experienced guidance.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We have 15 years of C-suite level experience in CPG and can advise you on all aspects of your business to make
          sure you reach your goals.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Most Fractional CFOs are simply CPAs who decided they wanted to make more money as a Fractional CFO. Deep
          industry experience is required in order to avoid the pitfalls in CPG.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As a small business, you may not be able to match the expertise that your larger competitors have in cash-flow
          projections, forecasting, raising capital, and systems. We’re here to give you that big-company advantage.
          Sometimes understanding what a potential hire or a new SKU will do to your cash runway can be a relief.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>I want to understand what is keeping you up at night and fix it.</p>
