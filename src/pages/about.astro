        I have run two CPG startups over the past 15 years. I know what it takes to succeed in CPG. I would love to help
        you chart the correct course for your company and achieve your personal and professional goals.

        I am driven by a desire to make your company successful. It is tragic when companies make simple, but fatal
        strategic errors. All the years of hard work and your shareholders’ money evaporates. The landscape is
        competitive. Let’s make sure you are charting the correct path.

        I was an investment banker, and also the Director of Quantitative Research for Fixed Income at Fidelity
        Investments, where I ran a group of Ph.D.s who valued Fidelity’s investments.
