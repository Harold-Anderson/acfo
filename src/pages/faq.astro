          The cost depends on the depth of our relationship.  We do not work on an hourly basis, but we might be able to sell you a block of time.

          Make sure you are using accrual-based accounting.  If you are manufacturing, make sure you have a functioning inventory and manufacturing system.`,

        Most Fractional CFOs, even if they specialize in one area, donâ€™t have deep operating experience in that area.   
        This makes it difficult to be a sounding board for the questions you will have.  
        Being a CPA turned Fractional CFO is not enough.  You deserve better.`,

                      be difficult to use and maintain.  It is a red flag, frankly. We are one of very few partners that

                      The flip side is that the Fractonal CFO
        is staking his/her reputation on you by talking to each investor.  We will not do this unless we have worked with you for a while.
        If your Fractional CFO cannot raise money for you, you need a different Fractional CFO.
